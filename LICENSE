LICENSING OF GENERATED CODE

Code generated by the zserio compiler is owned by the owner of the input
schema file(s) used when generating it. The applicable license of the
generated code follows from the license of those input schema file(s).
If the schema is authored independently, the generated code belongs
to the author and may be licensed freely. If the schema is subject to
third-party licensing terms, the generated code will be bound by those
terms accordingly.

The generated code is not standalone and requires the zserio runtime
library to be linked with it. The runtime library itself is covered by
the BSD-3-Clause license.
